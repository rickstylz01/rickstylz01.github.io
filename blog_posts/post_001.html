			<p class="margin-bottom-20"><span>Today I learned that I need to create more time for these side projects.</span>  

				I've completed my courses with Udacity, learning and re-learning basic elements of HTML, CSS, Ruby, and JS.<span>  I feel pretty confident with HTML and CSS.</span>  Once I get into Ruby territory things become rocky.  Once I get into JS territory, it's like trying to tread water in a raging river.

			<p class="margin-bottom-20">
				That being said, I also had to take a little hiatus due a family emergency, so I feel like I need to review a few things hence why I'm currently looking at youtube tutorials as well as some code academy courses on basic HTML.
