  I have started learning the basics about he Ruby API.  So far I've gone through different mehtods within the program.
</p>
<p>More specifically I've worked with with string methods -
  <ul>
    <li>.split</li>
    <li>Concatenating</li>
    <li>.sub</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>I've also worked with using loops and arrays.  I found out that <em>hashes</em> and <em>arrays</em> are pretty different as well.</p>
<p>What I learned was that Arrays are really more lists of things you can place into one variable whereas, Hashes can also be a list, but the list consists of key/value pairs.  Or objects and their values.</p>

<h5>Arrays</h5>
<p>An array can be something like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>color_array = [red, white, green, brown]</li>
</ul>

<h5>Hashes</h5>
<p>Hashes, again can also be lists but, they need a key/value pair:</p>
<ul>
  <li>color_hash = {
    red = fierce,
    white = valor,
    green = energy,
    brown = James
  }</li>
</ul>

<p>I also dove a little deeper into the Ruby knowledge pool and discovered that you can actually build your own classes as well as methods.  I haven't experimented much with that yet but it's really interesting.</p>
<p>Another thing I discovered and found to be interesting was that, in a language in which everything is an object, variables are the only exception.  Variables, from my understanding, are simply the labels for objects.</p>
<p>I also worked with some familiar things from my time using JavaScript like <em><strong>functionts</strong></em> and <strong><em>loops</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Some great tips I got for if statements were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Every if-statement must have an else</li>
  <li>If this else should never run because it doesn't make sense, then you must use a <em>die</em> function in the else that prints out an error message and dies</li>
  <li>Never nest if-statements more than two deep and always try to do them one deep.</li>
  <li>Treat if-statements like paragraphs, where each if-elsif-else grouping is like a set of sentences.  Put blank lines before and after.</li>
  <li>Your Boolean tests should be simple.  If they are complex, move their calculations to variables earlier in your function and use a good name for the variable.</li>
</ul>

<p>In terms of <em><strong>loops</strong></em>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use a while-loop only to loop forever, and that means probably never.  This only applies to Ruby; other languages are different.</li>
  <li>Use a for-loop for all other kinds of looping, especially if there is a fixed or limited number of things to loop over.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the more fun parts while studying the Ruby API was doing exercises on debugging! lol.  It was great because I found myself thinking about the milestone that I am at as opposed to a year ago when I didn't understand a lick of what I was looking at on screen. Now here I was <em>debugging</em> ruby syntax.</p>
<p>Anyways, while debugging, I also learned some useful tips:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Do not use a "debugger". A debugger is like doing a full-body scan on a sick person.  You do not get any specific useful information, and you find a whole lot of information that doesn't help and is just confusing.</li>
  <li>the best way to debug a program is to use <strong>put</strong> to print out the values of variables at points in the program to see where they go wrong.</li>
  <li>Make sure parts of your programs work as you work on them.  Do not write massive files of code before you try to run them. code a little, run a little, fix a little.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now I also created another decision based game but this time using ruby.  It was relatively easy.  I based it off "The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho" and kept the code based on if/else statments.  I created an start as well as an exit function that exits out of the game.  I wanted to incorporate using for-loops with arrays or maybe even hashes but I think I still need some more basic work with those.</p>
