  Continuing my progress with the Ruby API I've started learn about modules, classes, class variables and instance variables, initialization, mapping, and just reading more code to help me understand the language better.
</p>
<p>
  I also did some pair coding with Gino which honestly kind of left me a little more confused than I had hoped. lol.
</p>
<p>
  In any case, as far as Ruby understanding goes, it's become clearer the more that I work with key/object hashes that you can interlink or connect one object to another, also known as mapping,
  in a very intricate way.  But in a way where creating one thing can be the beginning block of creating something bigger.
</p>
<p>
 One example I thought was great was creating instances of different states.  Their respective state abbreviations to be linked to the state.  As well as the cities.  So if I'm looking for the city of the state of CA, then I might get
 LA or Los Angelas as an output. This is done through mapping.
</p>
<p>
  Modules, as have been explained to me are, <em>"...a specialized hash that can store Ruby code so you can access it with the <strong>.</strong> (dot) operator."</em>
</p>
<p>
  A class, similar to the description of modules, is a way to take a grouping of functions and data and place them inside a container so you can access them with the dot operator.
</p>
<p>
  I was having a hard time understanding <em>initialization</em> but, what I learned was, initializing is a way to be able to create a new instance of a "parent" class that will then inherit the parent class' traits.
  which makes things way easier than having to create a brand new class and re write the same traits.
</p>
<p>
  Now, <strong>instance variables</strong>.  When you create a new instance or object for the parent class.  Lets say for example we've created a Fish class.  We initialize it and maybe set one parameter as (color). Well first you have to create an instance variables within the object
  in order for the object to understand what is being mapped to that initial variable.  So we'll say <em>@color = color</em>  now if we create
  a new instance and let's say I want to create a Coy fish to be in the fish class so what I'll do is:
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Fish.new(orange)</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Now, because we created an instance variable mapping to the initial variable we placed in the <em>initialize()</em> parameter, the class now recognized "orange" as the <strong>color</strong> of the fish.
</p>
<p>
  Now when it comes to Class variables things are much more permanent.  A class variable, recognized by the double @@ sighn, is what I like to call a <em>super</em> command.  Not to be mistakes with the actual "super" method, which I'll go into detail, once I have better grips with it.
  Anyway a the class variable basically changes that variable within all sub classes of the parent class.
</p>
<p>
  I'm almost complete with the "Learn Ruby the Hard way" book that I've been learning all these methods from and it's kind of crazy to see the progress that I've made.
  Yes I am able to read code a little easier than before but there is still so much I don't know and still might as well be looking at heiroglyphics in some instances.  But I'm also more knowledgable in the way things are intertwinened, which is very exciting.
