	So, after a long hiatus, I've gotten back on the wagon.  
</p>
<p>
I started with reviewing the whole first half of the "Learning Ruby the hardway" book. Just to touch up some rust spots.
</p>
<p>
	My obstacle, today and yesterday, was creating a Skeleton file with a full directory.
</p>
<p>
First it was because the order of my directory wasn't correct.  I couldn't figure it out so I asked Gino if he could show me why and where my mistakes were.
</p>
<p>
Finally, after getting it done, I was trying to test out a "rake/testtask" file.  At first it wouldnt but then Gino discovered that the file was initially empty so we added the code needed.  
</p>
<p>
	After he saved me, from what could have been another 8hrs. of just  figuring that out, I had a small triumph.
</p>
<p>
My triumph was that I created a whole new repository for this skeleton file that I had been working on.  I tried to use the instructions gino had given me, that I made a note for but, I kept getting an error saying I had to "fetch" a file.  I had to use (git init) to initialize a new repository. 
</p>
<p>
I googled the problem and luckily there were pretty clear instructions on a different github page.
</p>
<p>
	Anyway, long story short, I created a new repository on github with my skeleton file, all through using the shell terminal. #awesome
