     <p> Today is Firday the 13th! and one of my "resolutions" is to try to code <em>something</em> atleast once a day. </p>

     <p> Yesterday I trid to add a video to my blog off of youtube but something went wrong.<br> I don't think I'm going to try to add a video again until later, I don't want to get caught up in just that to the point where it is just consuming my time. </p>

     <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SCEnPZ_LckI?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

     <p> OK, nevermind, So originally I was basing the syntax off of what I was learning in <strong> code academy</strong>.  But, actually, all I had to do was copy and paste the code that youtube gives you to embed.

      <br>
      <br>

      <p> In the code academy lesson they teach you to use the <em><strong> video </strong></em> tag.  But if your getting a video out of youtube then it isn't necessary. </p>

      <p> 4th Entry into my blog, I am starting to conduct meetings with clients.  My first client is someone who produces "regional Mexican" music.

        <br>
        <br>

        Basically what he wants is a site to be able to showcase his music and artists that are under his label while still being able to sell merchandise.

        <br>
        <br>

        This is a very important moment/experience for me because I am now looking at the business end of what a <em>web designer</em> goes through.  Everything from initiating the meeting to meeting the clients expectation as well as discuss options and possibilities and most importantly <strong>PRICING</strong>. </p>

        <p> Well besides all of that, as I mentioned before I am going through the basics of HTML through code academy, although it is helping me remember a lot of the little tricks of the trade <em>within HTML</em> I need to pass that and move onto things like <strong>CSS, RUBY,</strong> and <strong>JS</strong> to make a more functional and attractive site.</p> -->

        <p> So I F'd up and took a little break over the weekend.  But regardless I'm back and the first thing I began to re-educate myself on was creating links "at will".

          <br>
          <br>

          In other words, I can now make a link out of pictures as well as simple text.  All it comes down to is wrapping the <em>anchor</em> tag around whatever it is I'm trying to make a link out of.  So today I made the gif up at the top of my page into a link that opens a new page/tab to the Gangstarr wikipedia page.</p>

          <p> Also, as an update on my <em>clients</em>, I think I actually scared my potential client away.

            <br>
            <br>

            I think I scared him away because I started to explain that I wanted to have a meeting with him to understand his vision for the site.  Yadda yadda yadda; he hasn't responded back to either of my messages.  So I'm going to keep trying with him but otherwise I'm gonna keep it moving.

            <br>
            <br>

          I am going to continue my knowledge gains while still trying to get through to this person.</p>

          <p> So I forgot that, while transforming relatively anything into a link, I can also tag specific points in my site as an ID or class tag and create an unordered list with list items that can link you to that specific part.  </p>

          <p><em> e.g. </em></p>

          <ul>
            <li><a href="#welcome">Welcome!</a></li>
          </ul>

          <p> So now when you click the link it can instantly take you back to the top of the page right to the beginning <em>welcoming</em> sentence. </p>

          <p>Currently, I have just come to the end of the HTML lesson in codeacademy.  They gave me an ol (ordered list) of all the different things I learned.  Now, I could have just copy and pasted it all but, I thought instead of taking the cheap way, I could make my own ordered list (ol) and just type in the facts.  So...</p>

          <ol>
            <li>The (<strong>!DOCTYPE html</strong>) declaration should always be the first line of code in your HTML files. This lets the browser know what version of HTML to expect.</li>
            <li>The html element will contain all of your html code.</li>
            <li>Information about the web page, like the title, belongs within the (<strong>head</strong>) of the page.
            </li>
            <li>You can add a title to your web page by using the (<strong>title</strong>) element, inside of the head.
            </li>
            <li>A webpage title appears in a browser's tab.</li>
            <li>Anchor tags (<strong>a</strong>) tags are used to link to internal pages, external pages or content on the same page.</li>
            <li>You can create sections on a webpage and jump to them using (<strong>a</strong>) tags and adding <strong>ids</strong> to the elements you wish to jump to.
            </li>
            <li>Whitespace between HTML elements helps make code easier to read while not changing how elements appear in the browser.
            </li>
            <li>Indentation also helps make code easier to read. It makes parent-child relationships visible.
            </li>
            <li>Comments are written in HTML using the following syntax: <strong>(l.arrow)!-- comment --(r.arrow)</strong>.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p> So I started the day pretty much figuring out how to link my CSS stylesheet with my HTML document.  I was having a really hard time but I knew it had to be a mistake with the directory link.

            <br>
            <br>

          I had moved my CSS stylesheet a few times as well as re-doing the link directory on my HTML sheet.  Finally, after googling a bit, I just named the folder the stylesheet was in before everything else and VIOLA!.</p> -->

          <!--beginning of new 7th post-->

          <!-- <h2 class="uppercase">April 23. 2018</h2>

          <p> Ok so yesterday I dug into CSS a little bit because I'm trying to push it a bit.
            <br>
            As I mentioned before I want to get up to Ruby and JavaScript to really make my sites more user friendly as well as brush up my CSS skills to make sites more attractive.
            <br>
            <br>
            I was having a really hard time yesterday just linking my stylesheet to my HTML file but eventually I figured it out.
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm learning the different details about CSS like "chaining selectors".  For example,
            <br>
            <br>When writing CSS rules, it's possible to require an HTML element to have two or more CSS selectors at the same time.<br>

            This is done by combining multiple selectors, which we will refer to as chaining. For instance, if there was a <strong>.special</strong> class for h1 elements, the CSS would look like:
            <br>
            <br>

            <strong><em>h1.special {
             <br>
             <br>

           }</em></strong>
           <br>
           <br>
         The code above would select only the h1 elements that have a class of special. If a p element also had a class of special, the rule in the example would not style the paragraph. </p>

         <br>
         <br>
         <br>

         <p>Now for <strong> Nested Elements </strong>.

          <br>
          <br>

          In addition to chaining selectors to select elements, css also supports selecting elements that are nested within other HTML elements. For instance, consider the following HTML:

          <br>
          <br>

          <strong>(ul class='main-list')<br>
            (li)...(/li)<br>
            (li)...(/li)<br>
            (li)...(/li)<br>
          (/ul)</strong><br>
          <br>



          The nested (li) elements are selected with the following CSS: (.main-list li {})
          <br>
          <br>

          In the example above, (.main-list) selects the (.main-list) elemtents (the unordered list elements).  The nested (li) are selected by adding the <strong><em>li</em></strong> selector, sepereated by a space, resulting in (.main-list li) as the final selector (note the space in the selector).

          <br>
          <br>

        Selecting elements in this way can make our selectors even more specific by making sure they appear in the context we expect.</p> -->

        <!--end of post-->
        <!--beginning of new post-->

        <!-- <h2 class="uppercase"> April 24. 2018 </h2>

        <h3> Multiple Selectors </h3>

        <p>In order to make CSS more concise, it's possible to add CSS styles to multiple CSS selectors all at once.  This prevents writing repetitive code.

          <br>
          <br>

          Instead of writing <strong>font-family: Georgia</strong> twice for two selectors, we can separate the selectors by a comma to apply the same style to both, like this:

          <br>
          <br>

          <strong>(h1,<br>
            .menu {<br>
            font-family: Georgia;<br>
          })</strong>

          <br>
          <br>

          So, throughout the CSS lessons I laearned that...<br>
          <ul>
            <strong><em><li>CSS can change the look of HTML elements. In order to do this, CSS must select HTML elements, then apply styles to them.</li>
              <li>CSS can select HTML elements by tag, class, or ID.</li>
              <li>Multiple CSS classes can be applied to one HTML element.</li>
              <li>Classes can be reusable, while IDs can only be used once.</li>
              <li>IDs are more specific than classes, and classes are more specific than tags. That means IDs will override any styles from a class, and classes will override any styles from a tag selector.</li>
              <li>Multiple selectors can be chained together to select an element. This raises the specificity, but can be necessary.</li>
              <li>Nested elements can be selected by separating selectors with a space.</li>
              <li>The !important flag will override any style, however it should almost never be used, as it is extremely difficult to override.</li>
              <li>Multiple unrelated selectors can receive the same styles by separating the selector names with commas.</li></em></strong>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <br>

            <h3>CSS: Selectors and Visual Rules</h3>

            <h4>Opacity</h4>

            <p>Opacity is the measure of how transparent an element is. It's measured from 0 to 1, with 1 representing 100%, or fully visible and opaque, and 0 representing 0%, or fully invisible.
              <br>
              <br>
              Opacity can be used to make elements <strong><em>fade</em></strong> into others for a nice overlay effect.</p>

              <h4>Background Image</h4>

              <p>Css has the ability to change the background of an element.  One option is to make the background of an element an image.  This is done through the CSS property <strong><em>background-image</em></strong>.</p>

              <p>So I changed the background color to the page to give it a warmer feel and I went with beige.  I was having difficulty doing this so I did what any other good dev would do...<strong>google it</strong>.
                <br>
                <br>
                To accomplish this, instead of writing code in my stylesheet, I simply wrote the <em>style</em> property next to the body elemnt in my html code the same way I would if I was writing it in my stylesheet.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p> Deleted the images I had from before and put one of them as the background image to a <strong>div</strong>.  What this did was limit the image to the size of the div while still being able to let me configure other aspects like captions etc.</p> -->

                <h3> Review of visual Rules </h3>

                <ul>
                  <li>CSS declarations are structured into property and value pairs.</li>
                  <li>The <strong>font-family</strong> property difines the typeface of an element.</li>
                  <li><strong>font-size</strong> controls the size of text displayed.</li>
                  <li><strong>font-weight</strong> defines how thin or thick text is displayed.</li>
                  <li>The <strong>text-align</strong> property places text in the left, right, or center of its parent container.</li>
                  <li>Text can have two different color attributes: <strong>color</strong> and <strong> background-color</strong>.  <strong>color</strong> defines the color of the text, while <strong>background-color</strong> defines the color behind the text.</li>
                  <li>CSS can make an element transparent with the <strong>opacity</strong> property.</li>
                  <li>CSS can also set the background of an element to an image with the <strong>background-image</strong> property.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3> Introduction to the Box Model </h3>

                <p> Browsers load HTML elements with <strong><em>default position values</em></strong>.  This often leads to an unexpected and unwanted user experience, while limiting the views you can create.  The Box Model is an important concept to understand because you learn how elements are positioned and displayed on a website.</p>

                <p> For example, if you have set the background color of an element, you may have noticed that the color was applied not only to the area directly behind the element, but also to the area to the right of the element.  Also, if you have aligned text, you know it is aligned relative to something.  What is that something?</p>

                <p> All elements on a web page are interpreted by the browser as "living" inside of a box.  This is what is meant by <em> the box model </em>.</p>

                <p> For example, when you change the background color of an element, you change the background color of its entire box.</p>

                <p> The box model comprises the set of properties which define parts of an element that take up space on a web page.  The model includes the content area's size (<em>width and height</em>) and the element's <em>padding, border, and margin</em>.  <br>The properties include:
                  <ol>
                    <li><strong>Width and height</strong> -- specifies the width and height of the content area.</li>
                    <li><strong>Padding</strong> -- specifies the amount of space between the content area and the border.</li>
                    <li><strong>Border</strong> -- specifies the thickness and style of the border surrounding the content area and padding.</li>
                    <li><strong>Margin</strong> -- specifies the amount of space between the border and the outside edge of the element.</li>
                  </ol> -->
                  <!--BOX MODEL DIAGRAM IMAGE-->
                  <!-- <div class="boxgram">
                  </div>

                  <h3> Borders </h3>

                  <p>A <em>border</em> is a line that surrounds an element, like a frame around a painting.  Borders can be set with a specific <strong>width</strong>, <strong>style</strong>, and <strong>color</strong>.
                    <ol>
                      <li><strong>Width</strong> -- The thickness of the border. A border's thickness can be set in pixels or with one of the following keywords: <strong>thin</strong>, <strong> medium</strong>, or <strong>thick</strong>.</li>
                      <li><strong>style</strong> -- The design of the border. Web browsers can render any of <em>10 different styles</em>.  Some of these styles include: <strong> none </strong>, <strong>dotted</strong>, and <strong>solid</strong>.</li>
                      <li><strong>color</strong> -- The color of the border. Web browsers can render colors using a few different formats, including <em>140 built-in color keywords</em>.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p> The default border is <strong>medium none color</strong>, where <strong> color</strong> is the current color of the element.  If <strong>width</strong>, <strong>style</strong>, or <strong> color</strong> are not set in the CSS file, the web browser assigns the default value for that property.</p>

                    <h3> Border Radius </h3>

                    <p> You may have noticed that the borders highlight the true shape of an element's box: square.  Thanks to CSS, a border doesn't have to be square.</p>

                    <p>You can modify the corners of an element's border box with the <strong>border-radius</strong> property.</p>

                    <h3> Padding 1 </h3>

                    <p> The space between the contents of a box and the borders of a box is knowns as <em> padding</em>.  Padding is like the space between a picture and the frame surrounding it.  In CSS, you can modify this space between a picture and the frame surrounding it.  In CSS, you can modify this space with the <strong>padding</strong> property.
                      <br>
                      The padding property is often used to expand the background color and make content look less cramped.
                      <br>
                      If you want to be more specific about the amount of padding on each side of a box's content, you can use the following properties:
                      <ol>
                        <li><strong>padding-top</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>padding-right</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>padding-bottom</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>padding-left</strong></li>
                      </ol>
                    Each property affects the padding on only one side of the box's content, giving you more flexibility in customization.</p>

                    <h3> Padding 2 </h3>

                    <p> Another implementation of the <strong> padding</strong> property lets you specify exactly how much padding there should be on each side of the content in a single declaration.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      When using this implementation of the <strong> padding</strong> property, we must specify a padding value for all four sides of the element.
                      <br>
                      However, if the top and bottom values for padding will equal each  other, and the left and right values for padding will also equal each other, you can use the following shortcut:
                      <br>
                      The first value, <strong>5px</strong>, sets the padding value for the top and bottom sides of the content.  The second value, <strong>10px</strong>, sets the padding value for the left and right sides of the content.</p>

                      <h3> Margins </h3>

                      <p> The fourth and final component of the box model is <em>margin</em>.
                        <br>
                        Margin refers to the space directly outside of the box.  The <strong>margin</strong> property is used to specify the size of this space.
                        <br>
                        If the coe places 20px of space on the outside of the paragraph's box on all four sides.  This means that other HTML elements on the page cannot come within 20px of the paragraph's border.
                        <br>
                        If you want to be even more specific about the amount of margin on each side of a box, you can use following properties:
                        <ol>
                          <li>margin-top</li>
                          <li>margin-right</li>
                          <li>margin-bottom</li>
                          <li>margin-left</li>
                        </ol>

                      Each property affects the margin on only one side of the box, providing more flexibility in customization.</p>

                      <p> The margin property also lets you center content.  However, you must follow a few syntax requirements.</p>

                      <p> I've started to try out github but I feel overwhelmed.  My main problem is trying to find out how to view my blog in a website format instead of plain code.  This I can do simply with my own laptop but, when trying to let others see my progress and what it is I'm working on, I have to learn how to use github to post my projects.</p>

                      <p> Anyways I've asked for help on slack and I'm just waiting for a bit of help.  I also want to start making some type of portfolio so I'm going to brush up on my JavaScript skills.</p>

                      <h3> Properties </h3>

                      <p>When you introduce a new piece of data into a JavaScript program, the browser saves it as an instance of the data type.  An <strong><em>instance</em></strong> is an individual case (or object) of a data type.</p>

                      <p>JavaScript will save a new piece of data, like <em>'Hello'</em>, as a string <strong><em>instance</em></strong> in the computer's memory.  Another example, the number 40.7, is stored as an instance of the number data type.</p>

                      <p>An instance, like the string <em>'Helo'</em>, has additional information attached to it.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        For example, every string instance has a property called <strong>length</strong> that stores the number of characters in it.  You can retrieve property information by appending the string with a period and the property name.<br>
                        For example:
                        <ul>
                          <li>console.log('Hello'.length);</li>
                        </ul> -->

                        <!-- In the example above, the value saved to the <strong>length</strong> property is retrieved from the string, <em>'Hello'</em>.  The program prints <strong>5</strong> to the console, because <strong>Hello</strong> has five characters in it.</p>  -->
